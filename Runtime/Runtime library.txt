The runtime library is a good game library it could do with some work
on the movement system has it still need to have gravity and friction
add to it. 

Programming language:
  The inbuit programming langauge is very slow and has got
  many problems it cause games to crash all the time but its all i have . 

Graphics:
  The graphics system is very slow when it comes to drawing
  transparnt images and lacks pixel prefect collision  plus lacks functionlty.

Sound:
  The sound system is so bad you can only play one sound at a time and only
  wav files can be played.

Information:

The game Library for euphoria programmers this library was ment to be a 
full program that would of been a game makeing tool for all but has i have
worked on this i came to see that i did not have the skill to make a program 
like this so i now have a game library but no graphic user interface and no 
plans to write one or means so i have decided to released it to all the euphoria
programmers in the hope that some one will find it use full and i have all so
include some example games. this library has taken a lot of idears from the 
game maker tool made by mark overmeans. the game library has sprites objects rooms
instances of objects and many of the functions in the library are just like the ones 
in game maker. the speed of the library is not has fast as it could be because it 
uses the windows g d i graphics and not the directX graphics this is why the 
game library is slow but not that slow has i have made a pacman clone in it and 
this work fine on my old 555 mhz cpu and 128mb memory and 64mb graphics card and 
windows xp this game is include has one of the examples.

the game library is easy to use all you have to do is use the inbuilt functions
to make your game the hard parts like movement of objects and drawing of animated 
images are taken care of for you. all objects have events these events are used to call your 
user define procedure so when a object is frist create its create event will be trigger
and the step event will be trigger every step of the game and the keyboard event will 
be trigger when a key is pressed on the keyboard. there is no collision event but 
collisions are still easy to work with all you would have to do is use the 
check meeting function in the step a event to see if there has been a collision with
a object. (the collision event could be add to the game library). 

There is still a lot that could be done to improve the game library

The rooms need backgrounds working on 
  Tile background horizontally and/or vertically
  Stretch background fills the entire room
  The position of the background in the room
  Background scrolling by giving it a horizontal or vertical speed.
 
The view for a room seems to work ok and all the object outside a view are not draw 
and never change the view position in the draw event because it makes the screen 
fliker.

There is a graphics user interface room editor program included with this library 
to help you make the rooms for your games. there are some bugs. (source code included)

This library would be a good starting point for a game maker tool but it would 
need to have a directX library made for it with surpport for directX sound and
directX graphics. then all that needs to be done is to make the grapghic user 
interface and the 
inbuilt programming
language to run all the user defind actions scripts and code ;)

There are still some bugs in the library but these are not a problem all 
it needs is a bit of work on the collision checking procedures. The movement system
need a bit moor done to it to fix the bugs.
                       
I have add the automatic bounding box dection of sprites it use the top left of 
the frist image in a sprite has the key color. this is used for collsion detaction.

I have a new idear for the game library it is a new file system for puting all
the games images and sounds and anything else into a single file. this would be
of use because all the files inside the zip file could be unzipped to the temp 
directory. this would stop people from getting your images and sounds. the zip 
file has no comprsion and no encryptions.

The game library need to be able to draw 300 image at 30 fps
game library can draw 300 image at 30 fps these where not transprant images

i have tryed to run both game librarys on windows 98 and both of them would
not work i think it might be something to do with the limit on how many files
can be open at any one time under windows 98.

Changes:--============================================================--

hotkeys 
f4  switch between full screen and window mode
f6  pause the game or unpause the game

i have thout of a hundred thing to do to library to day.

=============================================================================
14/10/06
add full screen mode new function (switch_screen) automatic switch between the two

add sound system new function (add_sound) (play_sound) sound are keep in memory

add new function (reverse_dir) it will reverse direction for instance

fix bug in view center function

change the automatic bounding box now very fast was very slow

add new game (tank)  made some change to this game for tile backgounds

made change to the doc

add new file (function code) has some function that i have not add to the library

add new file (changes) has a list of changes made to the game library

add new function (centerwindow) used when the game startup and when switching 
between full screen and window mode
==============================================================================
15/10/06
change the windows api library to a new version from 0.45 to 0.6.6 this has
slow down the game library speed with the old win api i could draw 90 images 
at a speed of 55 and with the new win api and drawing 90 images its speed was 27 
with the old win api i had to draw  270 image to get the speed to 27 so i need 
to decide if haveing the new library is better or the old one the old one is
two times faster and the new one has many new function and lots moor. i staying 
with the old one.

with the new library i have add a graphics library the win32dib library is addon
to the win32 api library it will be used to take screen shoots of the screen 
that all i have setup up for

change the way automatic bounding box works there is now a progrbar for the new 
win32 library and the and code has been reduced need to make the function be 
automatic call when need be this can be turn off by setting the auto_bbox to 0

add the start event and end event to library these are not for objects
use the set event procedures the start event will be call befor any object
are created

add the graphics draw system for the library draw_text_lib color x y string
for devloping inbuilt drawing functions

change the way rooms work add the variable current_room and new functions
room next and room back when the game library startup it will automaticly
load the frist room in room list if one exsist.

change made it so the room caption can still be draw in full screen mode

change the rooms can now have tile background images

add the screen_save_part function but it very slow save the image has a 
bitmap in 24bit

fix bug for when the game was pause and in full screen the room caption was
still being write two the screen memory

add a variable call draw number this will tell you how many images are being
draw for each step add it to the debug info has will and add new varibale
debug_caption to turn on room caption all debug caption

add new function (instance_line_number) used to get a line_number 
for a object and the new function (instance_create_move) like its name
saids it crates a instance of a object and set it dir and speed to move.

made some change to the tank game it can now shoot.
==============================================================================
16/10/06
made many change to the library because i have add the offset variable 
to sprites all collision are now check by the sprite and not the instance
position on screen its not been test so there might still be bugs

add new function boundary it return true if object is at the edag of a room

completly change how the game library works drawing of the instance sprite
is now done by the library and so is the movement of a instance and the 
collision event is been handlde by the library and change how the library call
your code when a event is triggered only one event procedure for each object 
and many new event have been insert to the library there are now two variables
to use in your code the self and other variables self is your index in the 
list of instance and the other is all so a index to the list of instance the 
other variable is only used for the collision event it is index to the 
instance you collision with.  

add new events collision outside boundary mouse enter mouse leave






Need To Do List:--==========================================================--

add the function draw sprite

add the function (screen_save) save a bmp image of the screen 
good for screen shoots (done)

add the function (screen_save_part) (done)

add the function (screen_redraw) Redraws the room by calling all draw events.

add the function (screen_refresh) Refreshes the screen using the current 
room image (not performing drawing events). 

need to work on geting user input from the user like getting 
a string or a number or showing a question or just showing a message

need to make changes to the sprite system sprite need offset variables 
that will be used in drawing and collision this is should be esay and
need to add a lot of change to the way some of the functions work need
to add a lot of surport for automatic bounding bbox like full image
automatic or manual.

need to change the movement system because when two solid object collistion
they still past right frew each other but there is a procedure that stops
this from happening but there will be no collistion for those objects.
what need to be done is this there should all ready be a procdure to check
for solid object collistions inbuilt into the library just like in real life
the next thing that needs to done is this the collision function still need to
report the collistion.
the movement system still need more doing to it the friction and gravity need 
to be add i don't no how to go about this so into i do the movement system will
stay has it is its ok how it is. this might be hard

add the room create event to rooms call a user defined procedure when a room
is frist load in the game befor any object are created

need to updata the function out_sideroom and warp_object and grid because of the
offset variable for sprites *done

add the events room start and room end for objects to the room functions

draw_healthbar(x1,y1,x2,y2,amount,backcol,mincol,maxcol,direction,showback,showborder) 

With this function you can draw a healthbar (or any other bar that indicates some value, 
like e.g. the damage). The arguments x1, y1, x2 and y2 indicate the total area for the bar. 
amount indicates the percentage of the bar that must be filled (must lie between 0 and 100). 
backcol is the color of the background for the bar. mincol and maxcol indicate the color when 
the amount is 0 and 100 respectively. For an amount in between the color is interpolated. 
So you can easily make a bar that goes e.g. from green to red. The direction is the direction 
in which the bar is drawn. 0 indicates that the bar is anchored at the left, 1 at the right, 
2 at the top and 3 at the bottom. 
Finally showback indicates whether a background box must be shown and showborder indicated 
whether the box and bar should have a black border line.
